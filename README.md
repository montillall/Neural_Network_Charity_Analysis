# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview 

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, it is necessary to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. In order to do this analysis, it has been requested to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, the analysis will include oversampling the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk and evaluate the performance of these models to recommend on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

## Results
The results of the 6 machine learning models are described as follows:

### Naive Random Ovesampling

* Balanced Accuracy Score: 79%
* Precision: for high risk loans, the precision is low at 4% and high for low risk loans at 100%
* Recall: for high risk loans, the recall is 67% and for low risk loans at 91%


### Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier

![](Resources/EasyEnsembleClass.png)

* Balanced Accuracy Score: 93%
* Precision: for high risk loans, the precision is low at 7% and high for low risk loans at 100%
* Recall: for high risk loans, the recall is 91% and for low risk loans at 94%

## Summary
Looking at the results of the six models, the EasyEnsembleClassifer model resulted with an accuracy of 93% and a precision of 7% for High Risk loans, the recall was also high with this model compared to the others with a rate of 91%. For the Low Risk loans, the recall was also high with a rate of 94%. Given the better results of this model compare to the others, it is recommended to use this model for making predictions of credit risk
